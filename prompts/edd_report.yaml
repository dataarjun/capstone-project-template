    output: |
      **ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE REPORT**
      
      **SUBJECT:** Minister Adebayo Gov
      **PEP STATUS:** TRUE
      **SANCTIONS HITS:** NONE
      **RISK FACTORS:** HIGH_RISK_JURISDICTION_IR, LARGE_TRANSACTION
      
      **CRITICAL RISK INDICATORS:**
      - **PEP EXPOSURE**: High-risk due to government position
      - **LARGE TRANSACTION**: Significant amount requires scrutiny
      - **CROSS_BORDER_TRANSFER**: International wire transfer
      
      **INVESTIGATION FINDINGS:**
      This case involves a high-value international wire transfer by a PEP from a medium-risk jurisdiction. The combination of PEP status and large transaction amount creates elevated AML risk.
      
      **RECOMMENDATIONS:**
      1. Enhanced monitoring of all PEP transactions
      2. Verification of legitimate business purpose
      3. Consider SAR filing based on further investigation
      
      **NEXT STEPS:**
      1. Obtain additional documentation
      2. Verify source of funds
      3. Monitor for additional suspicious activity
